        <p>Did you know that as many of 30% of students are not learning at all. Schools are failing to teach them and students don’t think learning is fun. According to PsychCentral  “Most of the urban and rural students, primarily from families below the poverty level, are not getting even a rudimentary education. In fact, according to a recent study released by the America’s Promised Alliance (an organization chaired by Colin and Alma Powell), the U.S. has a 30 percent rate of students failing to graduate high school. But the really upsetting data is that in urban settings typically 50 to 70 percent of the students fail to graduate! (<a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/schools-fail-to-educate-at-least-30-percent-of-our-students#1">see story here</a>) This is more than an embarrassment. This is an epidemic of failure that costs America billions of dollars in lost productivity and high crime rates.” According to CMU, “Students see little value in the course or its content. Students do not believe that their efforts will improve their performance. Students are demotivated by the structure and allocation of rewards. Students do not perceive the classroom climate as supportive. Students have other priorities that compete for their time and attention” (<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/solveproblem/strat-lackmotivation/index.html">here</a>). This just shows the lack of motivation and trust that students have in the education system.<br/><br/>WE, ERAEDU, are here to solve this problem.</p>
